# chromodusk-classic-v4 README

This theme is a fork of the Chromodusk theme from [leelhn2345's Chromodynamics V3 Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=leelhn2345.chromodynamics-v3-theme) extension, but with most colors changed back to match the original [Chromodynamics Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=magicstack.Chromodynamics). I want to keep this theme close to the Chromodynamics theme, while improving it with new features like syntax highlighting. 

## Code samples:

Comming soon!
